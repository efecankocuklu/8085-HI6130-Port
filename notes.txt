/*
*	NOTES

	All registers are 16 bits.
	Registers are addressed using bits A15:A1
	In 8-bit mode, address bit A0 is used to identify which byte is being written to.
	
	char = 8-bit
	all others = 16 bits

	All registers should be unsigned int
	
	BC register addressing example:             i = pH6130BC->MASTER_CONFIG_REG;
	assuming this declaration is within scope:  const H6130BC pH6130BC = HI6130BC_BASE;
